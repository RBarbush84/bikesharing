# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze what factors might be important for gathering data to determine if a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa is viable and should be invested in, using data from New York City's existing bike sharing service. The NYC data used was from August 2019, a higher volume month for bike sharing, given the weather in NYC.

Top Starting Locations for rides. Visualizing where the highest volume of Citi Bike rides begin can allow you to identify where bikes are needed most to accommodate riders.

Top Ending Locations for rides. It is important to track where bikes end up after they are used as well. Are riders taking bikes from high volume starting locations and ending near the same areas? Or are they taking these bikes to low starting volume areas? Will there be a need to transport bikes back to the high volume areas?

Top starting times for rides. In addition to knowing where the highest demand for bikes would be, it is just as important to know when that demand happens over the course of a day. You will need to know when and where to have bikes to maximize ridership.

This heat map further shows when the peak demand for bikes occurs, and provides more information as to which days of the week have higher demand. Morning and evening work commute hours and weekend afternoons show the highest demand for bikes.

It is also important to know how long bikes are typically being used for. Are riders just taking a short ride to work or a bar/restaurant? Or are there more longer rides that could be for leisure or a workout?

Knowing other demographic information is also valuable for identifying a potential subscriber base and target markets. The below chart shows how long bikes are being used, and the genders of the riders.

The below heat map shows more information about when different genders use the bikes most often. The highest volume for males and females are around work commute hours, while males also see increased ridership during the late morning and into the afternoon on weekends.

![Daily Rides by Start Time and Gender](https://github.com/RBarbush84/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Daily%20Rides%20by%20Start%20Time%20and%20Gender.png)

This heat map shows who is using Citi Bikes most often, broken down by both gender and by if riders are subscribers to the service or just one-time customers, as well as what days of the week they are riding. This can all provide insight into who might be more likely to subscribe to the service and what the most common reasons are for using the bikes.
