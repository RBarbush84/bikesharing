# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze what factors might be important for gathering data to determine if a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa is viable and should be invested in, using data from New York City's existing bike sharing service. The NYC data used was from August 2019, a higher volume month for bike sharing, given the weather in NYC.
